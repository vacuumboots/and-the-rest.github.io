	<a name=0>#0: PROTEIN EGGS (for dem gains)</a>
<br>Requirements: 2 jumbo eggs, some mozzeralla or cheddar cheese (your choice), a mayonnaise (like Hellmann's olive oil), 2 english muffins (preferrably the kind that has more protein, check your local supermarket for details), and preferrably a pan with a lid</br>

<br>This is so easy, it gets a zero on how hard it is to make. Its good for you people going to the gym at the wee hours of the morning.</br>

<br>Alright so you are gonna want to start with heating your pan up to just before medium, on a scale of 1-12 on the dial, it should be about a 5 (if 6 is the medium). Put some butter or olive oil on the pan so the eggs don't get wrek'd. While the pan is heating, toast the first english muffin and get all of your ingredients ready. (Protip: if you have a bagel mode, use it. It will toast the inside of the muffins leaving the outside relatively cool so you don't burn yourself) It shouldn't take your pan that long to heat up since its only below medium. Now crack your eggs into the pan and put the lid on it. No fancy spices here fellas, just plain old egg sandwich. Once the eggs are in, crank the heat up to medium (6 on a scale of 1-12 on the dial). </br>

<br>By this point your first english muffin should be done toasting, so shove the other one in there to toast (those with fancy 4-slot toasters can ignore this step as you probably figured out you can toast both muffins at once). This is the point to check your eggs. If you've ever made eggs before, you can tell when they are getting ready to flip. If not, look for a certain type of firmness around the edges. Its best to use a metal spatula because they have that razor-like edge. I've not had much success flipping an egg successfully with a rubber spatula. </br>

<br>Once the eggs are flipped, prepare the english muffins. By now, the second english muffin should be toasted, so you are good to go. Put mayonnaise only on the bottom of the muffin, not the top. Don't want too much mayo, it isn't really good for you in comparison to all of the other ingredients we have on this roster. Put your cheese of choice on the top of the muffin, breaking it up so it doesnt go everywhere, yet completely encases the muffin itself. You can use the breaks on and put them on the bottom.</br>

<br> At this time, your eggs should be complete. Take them out of the pan and put one egg on one muffin and one egg on another. If the yellow part is hard and falls out of the white part, just discard it. Its full of cholesterol anyway. If its slightly runny, thats good it just improves the taste, but if its hard it just tastes like crap (to me). You want to place the eggs on the bottom muffin, and put the top on it so the cheese can soak in and melt. Wait for a minute so the cheese can melt and you have yourself a PROTEIN EGG sandwich.</br>

  <a name=1>#1: Chicken Alfredo </a>
  <br>
Requirements: 1 Jar of Alfredo Sauce, 1 Box of Pasta of your choice, Some garlic salt and lemon pepper, 2 chicken breasts, shredded mozzerella (if you want) </br>

<br>This is a classic, it was my first recipe that I perfected. </br>

<br>Start with Pan-Frying 2 chicken breasts until they are done. I cook them on a frying pan until they are nice and juicy to the taste. Do NOT cook them frozen. Make sure they defrost from the beginning of the day. They should be squishy to the touch when you put them on the pan. The pan itself should be buttered up, or olive oiled up. Put the chicken on medium heat until you're done with the pasta.</br>

<br>Meanwhile, put the pasta in boiling water and cook it until its done. Once it gets close to being done, turn up the heat on the chicken and add the garlic salt and lemon pepper. I like to add garlic salt to one side and lemon pepper to the other. You could also choose to add garlic salt to one breast and lemon pepper to the other, since its all going to the same place anyway. Just try not to overdo it</br>

<br><caution>/!\ Caution! /!\</caution></br>

<br>Depending on the size of your chicken, it might take more or less time to grill. If you have one of those fancy meat thermometers around, the ideal temp for chicken is 165F or 75C. Otherwise, cook it until its nice and juicy. In my experience, the middle is A LITTLE pink but NOT ALOT. It should be juicy but not salmonella juicy. Also, check the time to doneness for your pasta, it varies per noodle type. Use good judgement, if you think your chicken is gonna take a long time to grill/bake/cook, then bring the water up to a slow boil, or boil the pasta while you are cubing the chicken. These tips ensure that your pasta and chicken will be really hot when you add the alfredo and mozzeralla.</br>

<br>Again while the chicken is finishing up, drain the pasta, and place it into a large enough bowl so you can put everything in. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board or mat, and cut it into cubes. Once it has been cut in cubes, put it in the bowl with the pasta, then pour all of the alfredo sauce in. Mix it up real good, like with one of those salad mixers, the giant spoon and fork type deal. </br>
<br>After you have mixed it up, test the temperature a bit. It should come out nice and warm. Serve with a fork to your favorite peons, or yourself over several days. Trust me, an entire box of pasta and 2 chicken breasts is enough to feed you for a whole week.
